1.     First of all, go to the AWS portal, and create a new instance. As
·       Name: jenkins-server
·       AMI: ubuntu.
·       Instance type: t2.micro (free tier).
·       Key pair login: Create > docker.pem.
·       Allow HTTP.
·       Allow HTTPS.
·       (Download the .pem file.)
·       Click on Launch Instance.

2.    Now, we will allow ports 8080 and 8001 for this machine from a security group. We can find the security group in the VM description. Now, here we need to allow “Inbound Rule”

3.     Now, connect to the EC2 instance that you have created. Copy the SSH from server

4.     Go to the download folder, where the .pem file is placed and open the terminal in the same location, and paste the SSH.

5.     Install Jenkins/Docker if not already installed. 

6.     Goto Jenkins Dashboard and Click on “New Item”
·       Name: declarative_pipeline
·       Select: Pipeline
      Description: This is a demo pipeline project.

7.    Pipeline Script:
              pipeline{
                            agent any
                            stages{

                                                                        script{
                                                         sh "docker build --no-cache -t react_django_demo_app ."

                                           }
                                           stage{
                                                          steps{

                                                         sh "docker run -p 8001:8001 -d react_django_demo_app"
                                                                        }
